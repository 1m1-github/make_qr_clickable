# make_qr_clickable
improvement idea for touch screen operating systems

systems like iOS, Android, etc. should detect qr codes on the screen and make them clickable default.

this allows for light <-> touch communication.

currently a user has to screenshot, lens/detect qr, click.

OS could overlay qr destination as utf8 or ask user for confirmation before opening link.

this allows people to share links as qr codes on their websites and still being easy to follow e.g. on mobile devices. websites can make those qr codes into buttons. better yet, make all qr codes that are visible, clickable.
